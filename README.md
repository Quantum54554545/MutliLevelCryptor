# Advanced Multi-Layer Encryptor

This repository contains an advanced, multi-layer encryptor designed to provide maximum security by combining multiple encryption techniques and algorithms. The encryptor employs XOR, AES, HMAC, and PBKDF2 for robust encryption, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and resistance against common cryptographic attacks.

## Features

### Multi-layer encryption:
- XOR Encryption: Adds an additional layer of complexity.
- AES Encryption: Industry-standard symmetric encryption with a 256-bit key.
- HMAC Verification: Ensures data integrity by verifying authenticity.
- PBKDF2 Key Derivation: Secure key generation with salt to protect against brute-force attacks.
- Salted encryption: Generates a unique salt for each encryption to prevent replay attacks.
- Integrity protection: Verifies the integrity of the encrypted data using HMAC.
- Randomized Initialization Vectors (IVs): Ensures every encryption operation is unique.
